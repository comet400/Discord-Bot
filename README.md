# Discord-Bot
Python based discord bot that have a simple ai and Wikipedia integrated on it

how it works:
the bot in question will take in consideration past user responses and answers in order to generate a good response
if the response is sent as a bad one, the bot will prompt the user for a good response
the bot also analizes briefly which answer has most positive feedback for the next generation
all responses were passed by another user at some point.

commands:
!chat = prompts the bot for an answer based on what it has in its database
!ask = searches in wikipedia for an appropriate answer
